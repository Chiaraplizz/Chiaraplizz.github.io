Hi, Iâ€™m Chiara and I'm a never-ending learner, especially interested in deep learning and computer vision.
I'm a third year PhD student of the VANDAL (Visual AND Multimodal Applied Learning) laboratory at Politecnico di Torino (Italy), supervised by prof. Barbara Caputo. I am interested in Egocentric Vision and Video Understanding.
