Hi, Iâ€™m Chiara and I'm a third year PhD student of the [VANDAL](http://vandal.polito.it/) (Visual AND Multimodal Applied Learning) laboratory at [Politecnico di Torino (Italy)](https://www.polito.it/), supervised by prof. [Barbara Caputo](https://www.polito.it/en/staff?p=barbara.caputo). I am interested in Egocentric Vision and Video Understanding.
